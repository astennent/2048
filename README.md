2048 Android
===============

How to play:
---------------

Swipe left, right, up, and down to move tiles on the board. Combine two tiles with the same value to create a new tile with double the points. Earn points with every pair of tiles you merge together, and play until you reach the 2048 tile!
In addition to the classic 4x4 grid, this game includes two extra game modes:

Fours:
---------------
Control four 2x2 boards at the same time. When a board has no more moves, it "freezes" and you cannot do anything with it until it is unfrozen. Once the board thaws, it is cleared and you can control it again. Each time a board recovers from being frozen, the tiles are worth more points. However, the board will take longer to thaw each time it freezes. The game ends when all four boards are frozen at the same time, so the key is to maintain a balance of caution and ambition when you play!

Timed:
---------------
Similar to classic mode, but now you have to watch the clock. Combine tiles to add time, and bring the timer to maximum to increase the value of all your current and future tiles. But be careful. Filling up the clock will also make the time drop faster
